requires ofxSyphon github.com/astellato/ofxSyphon, ofxMidi github.com/danomatika/ofxMidi and ofxDatGui github.com/braitsch/ofxDatGui addons

for windows and linux check the noSyphon folder for alternate versions of some files to copy over into the src folder to get u up and running in syphon free zones

if you have never used oF and/or Xcode before here are some troubleshooting tips to try before contacting me
1. the entire folder structure needs to be intact and moved into the apps/myApps folder within the openframeworks folder
2. try running project generator and importing this folder (with the abovementioned addons) if theres still errors
